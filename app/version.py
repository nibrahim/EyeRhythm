Product version
===============

Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (https://semver.org): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

Current release is ``1.0.1``. Bump:

* PATCH (1.0.x) — fixes that do not change how people use the app
* MINOR (1.x.0) — new features that stay compatible
* MAJOR (x.0.0) — breaking changes

Packaging (Mac Info.plist, Windows exe/Setup) and Settings → About all
read this module. Change the number here, then match ``MyAppVersion`` in
``for_windows/for_developers/EyeRhythm.iss`` (a unit test checks that).
